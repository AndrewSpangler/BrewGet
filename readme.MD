Very WIP
Windows: To run do the normal python venv / requirements stuff, launch the app, and go to http://127.0.0.1:443
Linux: The commands should be very similar idk 
Needs Python 3.9 or newer

```
git clone https://github.com/AndrewSpangler/BrewGet.git
cd BrewGet
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```
